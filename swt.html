    <h3 class="top">SCOTTISH WILDLIFE TRUST</h3>

<p class="top">For over 50 years, the Scottish Wildlife Trust has worked with its members, partners and supporters in pursuit of its vision of healthy, resilient ecosystems across Scotland’s land and seas. <br><br>
The Trust successfully champions the cause of wildlife through policy and campaigning work, demonstrates best practice through practical conservation and innovative partnerships, and inspires people to take positive action through its education and engagement activities. It also manages a network of around 120 wildlife reserves across Scotland and is a member of the UK-wide Wildlife Trusts movement.<br><br>
Since its formation in April 1964, the Scottish Wildlife Trust has celebrated many achievements and has grown into Scotland’s leading nature conservation charity.<br><br>
Since employing its first member of staff in 1965, the Trust has grown considerably in both strength and number.
