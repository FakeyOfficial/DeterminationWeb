<!-- its hard to describe something that does not exist-->
<p class="top"> The game was simple to code however it was also hard for 1st project. Firstly I gathered ideas for the game. I wrote what the game will be about, story in it, character and gameplay. <br><br>
    To make it easier for myself, I decided to make a 2D game rather than 3D as it would be easier to code. I decided to make a 2D running game where main character has to get from point A to B in time limit, and at the same time, avoid objects and enemies on the way that could stop him. <br><br>
    Player could swipe up or down (or use buttons) to control character. <br><br>
    After deciding on story, gameplay, and events in game, I wanted to decide on how each level will be different from each other. 1st level would be like a tutorial level showing all enviromental objects like mud, rivers, old bridges. It will give opportunity to player to test all functions of game. Other levels could have different weather conditions and will be longer and harder to finish.<br><br>
    There was also a lot of graphical work. Most of assets are made by me. Also graphics, UI, textures, and animations.<br><br>
    Here is some of complicated game code.
