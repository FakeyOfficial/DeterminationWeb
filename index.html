<h3 class="top">ABOUT THE GAME:</h3>

<p class="top">Determination is a game about the father fox coming back from the hunt, to feed his family. 
    The twist is that he needs to manage get back home before midnight and total darkness. 
    As he holds his hunted food, there will be other predators that had no luck in hunting and will try to steal the hunted food by father fox. 
    The darker it gets the more danger he will encounter on way back. Father fox can be caught 3 times in one level. 
    To get away player needs to spam tap on screen. 4th time will be fatal. <br></p>
    
    <img id="fatalGameSS" src="lvlfail_adobe.jpg" alt="fatalGameSS" style="width:350px;height:170px;" ><br>
    <p class="top">Player swipes up and down (or use buttons) to control character to jump over or sneak under the enemies or other objects such as fallen trees, mud, water, old huts etc. The time left will be indicated by timer and day-night cycle. Run starts at 12 PM and ends at midnight. Other predators will show up after 6 PM and at 10 PM there will be a group of wolfs following the fox close-by. This gives an intense tension on player to not crash or get caught once. Player can use a speed boost called “determination”. It triggers the foxes’ brain to release the stress hormones and sympathetic nervous system. This leads to bodily changes that prepare father fox to be more efficient in a danger: The brain becomes hyperalert, pupils dilate, the bronchi dilate and breathing accelerates. Heart rate and blood pressure rise. This takes time of about 2 seconds after boost is activated. After the 2 seconds, father fox runs 200% faster for 30 seconds. <br><br>
    Each new level will get harder. There are 6 levels in game. *It is planned to introduce upgrade system to speed of character in normal condition, in mud/water and while in determination boost. *
